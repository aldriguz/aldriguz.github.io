Hi, I'm Kevin and wellcome to my special blog.

I computer scientist from Peru, I wanted a lot to have my own blog since years ago to publish and share what I very much like. I like technology, computer science, algorithms, videogames (specialy Nintendo ones like Zelda) and other things.

As a fullstack developer and self-taught person I tryed some things like Laravel, PHP, Docker, Unity, Vuforia, Blender, OpenGL, OpenCL, Qt Framework. I hope to share some posts related to all I mentioned here.

The things I enjoy is learn something new always, technology or another field of the life. I want to be an expertise in programming and this blogs maybe is the path to achieve this goal. Don't be surprise to find not tech or computer science related posts here...

Here I list some of the things you will find on this blog, I hope you enjoy this.

- Computer Science Theory
- Programming (Tips & Tricks)
- Development Tools
- Travel experiences
- Videogames
- Computers Architecture
- Personal things

My experience is related on design and build products, using Microsoft (.Net & C#) and Open Source technologies, fullstack web technologies. 

University leave an important logic knowledge and some programming languages introduction like C/C++, Java, Prolog, Scheme, OpenGL, Assembly, Linux.
